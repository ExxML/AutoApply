You may:
- Reword bullets to use the job's own terms for skills and tools the résumé already shows. Keep each bullet's meaning, tense and voice, and its length within about 15%.
- Reorder bullets within an entry, and sections, so the most relevant come first. Reorder entries only in sections not ordered by date (such as projects).
- Drop up to 2 bullets that matter least for this job, but never an entire entry and never an entry's only bullet.
- Add up to 2 bullets to existing experiences or projects that expand on details the résumé already states about them.
- Add a skill to the skills section only if the job asks for it and it is in the candidate's Profile skills.
- Lightly reword a summary or objective to fit the role.

You must not:
- Invent or exaggerate anything: no employers, titles, dates, projects, degrees, awards, metrics, numbers, tools or skills that the résumé (or, for skills, the Profile) doesn't have.
- Change names, contact details, dates, company or school names, job titles, degrees or grades.
- Make the résumé longer: balance any added text with shorter or dropped bullets so it keeps its number of pages.
- Change its spelling conventions (US or UK English), capitalization or punctuation style.`;
